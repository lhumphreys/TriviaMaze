To compile the code in eclipse, do the following:

	1. Locate the .zip folder named 'triviagame.zip'.

	2. In your eclipse workspace directory, unzip the file into a folder
	and name it (sugestion: name it 'TriviaGame').

	3. Open Eclipse and go to File->New->Java Project.

	4. Name the new Project the same name you gave the extracted files of
	triviagame.zip (in this case, 'TriviaGame').

	5. The folder you placed in the workspace should now be a java project in
	eclipse. To run the game, open the GameLoop.java file (contained in the 'core'
	package) and click 'Run'.
